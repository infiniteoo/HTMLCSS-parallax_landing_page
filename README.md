![example_gif](./example.gif)

### About

Utilizing the Rellax.js plugin we can easily implement a 3D smooth scrolling effect to create this mock Parallax landing page clone. Using the data parameter on elements you can make them scroll at varying speeds compared to others:

```
data-rellax-speed="5"

```

or for small screens:

```

data-rellax-xs-speed="-1"

```
